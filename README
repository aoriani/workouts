The repo will host my code workouts

At his daily working routine, a software engineer is not exposed to all sort of problems.
Your boss keeping putting in the same task, you ending up doing the same boring things. 
Some skills you grasped during years will became  vagues images from a distant past.
Like a athlete that does not exercise his/her muscles, they will become flacid.

So you need to keep working out and ready for any challenge.
